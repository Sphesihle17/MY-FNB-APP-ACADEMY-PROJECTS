    <h2>What is a Boat?</h2>
    <p>Boats are watercrafts designed to float and travel on water. They are commonly used for transportation, fishing, recreation, and rescue operations. Boats can vary in size from small canoes to large ferries.</p>
    <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The earliest boats were likely dugout canoes made from hollowed-out tree trunks!</p>
